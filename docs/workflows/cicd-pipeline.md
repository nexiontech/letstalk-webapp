# CI/CD Pipeline for LetsTalk Web Application

## Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the LetsTalk web application. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to different environments, ensuring consistent quality and reliability.

## Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Code Commit**: Developers commit code to feature branches
2. **Build**: The application is built and dependencies are installed
3. **Test**: Automated tests are run to verify code quality and functionality
4. **Review**: Code is reviewed by team members
5. **Integration**: Code is merged into the develop branch
6. **Staging Deployment**: The application is deployed to a staging environment
7. **Production Deployment**: The application is deployed to the production environment

## Branch Strategy

Our branching strategy follows a modified GitFlow approach with the following branches:

### Long-lived Branches

- **`production`**: Main stable branch containing production-ready code
  - Direct commits are prohibited
  - Changes are merged via pull requests from the `develop` branch
  - Each merge to production triggers a deployment to the production environment

- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features and fixes
  - All feature work must be merged here first
  - Changes are merged via pull requests from feature branches
  - Each merge to develop triggers a deployment to the staging environment

### Short-lived Branches

- **`feature/*`**: For new features or enhancements
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged to: `develop`
  - Naming convention: `feature/LT-XXX-descriptive-name`

- **`fix/*`**: For bug fixes
  - Created from: `develop` (or `production` for hotfixes)
  - Merged to: `develop` (and `production` for hotfixes)
  - Naming convention: `fix/LT-XXX-descriptive-name`

- **`refactor/*`**: For code refactoring without changing functionality
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged to: `develop`
  - Naming convention: `refactor/LT-XXX-descriptive-name`

- **`docs/*`**: For documentation changes
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged to: `develop`
  - Naming convention: `docs/LT-XXX-descriptive-name`

- **`test/*`**: For adding or modifying tests
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged to: `develop`
  - Naming convention: `test/LT-XXX-descriptive-name`

## Feature Branch Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. Ensure you're on the latest `develop` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/LT-XXX-descriptive-name
   ```

3. Implement your changes, making regular commits:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement feature X"
   ```

4. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/LT-XXX-descriptive-name
   ```

5. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch

### Pull Request Requirements

All pull requests must meet the following requirements:

1. **Title**: Clear and concise description of the changes
2. **Description**: Detailed explanation of the changes, including:
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - How it was tested
   - Any related issues or tickets

3. **Reviewers**: At least one required reviewer from the development team
4. **Tests**: All automated tests must pass
5. **Code Quality**: Code must meet the project's coding standards
6. **Documentation**: Updated documentation for any new or changed functionality

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- All new code must have unit tests
- Unit tests must cover at least 80% of the code
- Unit tests must pass before a pull request can be merged

### Integration Tests

- Integration tests must be written for any new API endpoints or services
- Integration tests must pass before a pull request can be merged to `develop`

### End-to-End Tests

- End-to-end tests must be written for any new user-facing functionality
- End-to-end tests must pass before a pull request can be merged to `production`

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

- Triggered automatically when code is merged to the `develop` branch
- Deploys to the staging environment
- Runs integration and end-to-end tests
- Notifies the team of successful or failed deployments

### Production Deployment

- Triggered automatically when code is merged to the `production` branch
- Requires manual approval from a project manager or team lead
- Deploys to the production environment
- Runs smoke tests to verify the deployment
- Notifies the team of successful or failed deployments

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment fails or causes issues in production, follow these steps to roll back:

1. **Identify the Issue**: Determine what's causing the problem
2. **Initiate Rollback**: Trigger a rollback to the previous stable version
   ```bash
   # For AWS Amplify
   aws amplify start-deployment --app-id <app-id> --branch-name production --job-id <previous-job-id>
   ```
3. **Verify Rollback**: Ensure the rollback was successful and the application is functioning correctly
4. **Document the Issue**: Create a ticket to track the issue and prevent it from happening again
5. **Fix the Issue**: Create a fix branch from `develop` to address the issue
6. **Deploy the Fix**: Follow the normal deployment process to deploy the fix

## Security and Compliance Checkpoints

### Code Scanning

- Static code analysis is performed on all pull requests
- Security vulnerabilities are identified and must be addressed before merging
- Dependency scanning is performed to identify vulnerable dependencies

### Compliance Checks

- Code must comply with the project's coding standards
- Accessibility requirements must be met for all user-facing changes
- Data privacy requirements must be followed for any changes involving user data

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Application performance is monitored in all environments
- Alerts are sent to the team for any performance degradation or errors
- Logs are collected and analyzed to identify issues

## CI/CD Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline automation
- **AWS Amplify**: For deployment to AWS
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
- **ESLint**: For code quality checks
- **SonarQube**: For code scanning and security analysis

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

- Local development environment
- Uses LocalStack for AWS service emulation
- Configuration stored in `.env.local` file (not committed to Git)

### Staging Environment

- AWS environment for testing
- Uses real AWS services with test data
- Configuration stored in AWS Parameter Store

### Production Environment

- AWS environment for production
- Uses real AWS services with production data
- Configuration stored in AWS Parameter Store with restricted access

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested and reviewed before being deployed to production, maintaining the quality and reliability of the LetsTalk web application.
