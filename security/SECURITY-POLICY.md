# Security Policy

## Dependency Vulnerability Management

This document outlines our approach to managing security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

### Current Security Status

✅ **All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities addressed**  
✅ **Regular dependency updates implemented**  
✅ **Automated security scanning in place**

### Known Low-Risk Vulnerabilities

#### Bootstrap 5.3.6 Carousel XSS Vulnerabilities

**CVE-2024-6484 & CVE-2024-6531**
- **Severity**: Medium (CVSS 6.1)
- **Component**: Bootstrap carousel component
- **Risk Assessment**: **LOW** for this application
- **Status**: Suppressed with justification

**Justification for Suppression:**
1. **Component Not Used**: The application does not use the Bootstrap carousel component
2. **No Attack Vector**: The vulnerable `data-slide` and `data-slide-to` attributes are not present in our codebase
3. **Verification**: Comprehensive codebase search confirms no carousel usage
4. **Mitigation**: Bootstrap is only used for utility classes and grid system

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Codebase search results (no matches found):
grep -r "carousel" src/ --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.css"
grep -r "data-slide" src/ --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.html"
grep -r "data-slide-to" src/ --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.html"
```

### Dependency Update Policy

1. **Critical/High Vulnerabilities**: Immediate update required
2. **Medium Vulnerabilities**: Assess impact and update within 30 days
3. **Low Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate during regular maintenance cycles
4. **False Positives**: Document and suppress with proper justification

### Security Scanning Tools

- **npm audit**: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency-Check**: OWASP dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Snyk**: Automated vulnerability monitoring
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated alerts enabled

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- **Email**: security@letstalk-webapp.com
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory

### Regular Security Reviews

- **Monthly**: Dependency vulnerability assessment
- **Quarterly**: Security policy review
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security audit
